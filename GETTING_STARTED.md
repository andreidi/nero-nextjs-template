# Welcome to your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React website template!

You're now on your way to building a stunning website with Next.js and React.


<br/>

## To get started, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Replace the Mock Data:

Open the `src/utils/data.ts` file and replace the mock data and text with your own content.

Update the images in `public` folder and any other elements to customize your website and make it uniquely yours.

Don't forget to customize the [meta tags](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) for SEO optimization.

### 2. Develop Further:

Once you have replaced the mock data, you can start developing further.

Take advantage of the powerful features of Next.js and React to add more functionality to your website.

You can leverage Next.js's server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes to create dynamic and performant web applications.

### 3. Deploy with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

When you're ready to launch your website, you can easily deploy it using Vercel or Netlify.

Both platforms provide seamless integration with Next.js and React, allowing you to deploy your website with just a few clicks.

Simply connect your repository, configure your build settings, and your website will be live in no time.
